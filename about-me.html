    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>For as long as I can remember, people have opened up to me. It wasn't the surface level conversation(s), but the real, heavy, vulnerable things.</p>

    <p>And maybe that’s you, too. You show up, do the things you're “supposed” to do, keep smiling. But inside, you’re tired. Maybe lost.</p>

    <p>I get it, because I’ve been there myself.</p>

    <p>A few years ago, I hit a wall. I was burned out. Not just tired, but emotionally drained.</p>

    <p>That’s when I found coaching. Or maybe I should say: that’s when coaching found me.</p>

    <p>It wasn’t magic. It didn’t “fix” everything overnight. But what it did do was give me space. Space to hear myself again.</p>

    <p>Coaching helped me reconnect with myself, with my values, with the kind of life I actually wanted to live.</p>

    <p>Now, I coach from that place—not just with tools and training, but with lived experience.</p>

    <p>I know what it’s like to feel stuck... I also know this: things can shift. You don’t have to do it all alone. And you don’t have to stay in survival mode.</p>

    <p>Coaching isn't about being “perfect” or “fixed.” It’s about giving yourself the chance to be <em>real</em>—maybe for the first time in a long time.</p>

    <p>If any of this resonates, you're not weird or broken. You're human. And you're in the right place ♡</p>
